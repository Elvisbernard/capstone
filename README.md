Capstone project for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.<br>
This repository is about the Udacity capstone project for Data Scientist. During that project, I will have a look at how using unsupervised learning can help us understand the different accommodations available on Boston AirBnB.

# Summary of the blog:
After a general introduction on unsupervised learning, two methods are explained in more details: DBSCAN and KMeans. These two methods of clustering have been applied to the dataset and the different clusters resulting are visualised in a map. Different characteristics of the clusters (localisation of the cluster, number of accomodations, reviews, prices...)will then be investigated. Finally some conclusions are drawn from the analysis.
